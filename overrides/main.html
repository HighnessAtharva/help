{#
  Template overrides for Material for MkDocs
  
  This base template extends the Material theme's base template
  and adds a custom banner at the top of all pages using the
  'announce' block, which is the recommended way to add announcements
  in Material for MkDocs.
  
  The announce block appears before the header and is ideal for
  site-wide announcements, banners, or important notices.
#}

{% extends "base.html" %}

{#
  Override the announce block to include our custom banner.
  The announce block is designed for announcement bars and appears
  at the very top of the page, before the header.
#}
{% block announce %}
  {% include "partials/banner.html" %}
{% endblock %}
