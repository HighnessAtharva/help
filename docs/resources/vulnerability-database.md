# Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Sources

This page lists the external data sources AccuKnox uses for vulnerability enrichment and threat intelligence.

## Vulnerability Sources

![Vulnerability Database Architecture](https://i.ibb.co/F4fm2hMz/vuln-db.png)

### NIST NVD

The [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) feed provides standardized CVE records.

### NVIDIA

[NVIDIA security advisories](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/) covering GPU, driver, and platform vulnerabilities.

### Microsoft MSRC

[Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/) security advisories for Windows and Microsoft products.

### Linux Vulnerability DB System

A dedicated ingestion and enrichment system for Linux and OS-level vulnerabilities.

#### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Centralized Data** | Pulls CVEs from NVD and multiple threat intel feeds |
| **Automatic Enrichment** | Enriches CVEs with EPSS score, CISA KEV exploitation status, public PoC availability from GitHub, and CWE classification |
| **API Access** | Supports querying by CVE ID (e.g., `CVE-2024-1234`) or filtering by severity, keywords, exploit status (PoC or CISA KEV), and CWE IDs |

#### Update Schedule

Daily synchronization runs for NVD updates, EPSS scores, CISA KEV data, and GitHub PoC indicators.

## Threat Intelligence Sources

### IP2Location

[IP2Location](https://www.ip2location.com/) provides IP reputation and geolocation intelligence used for context and risk scoring.
